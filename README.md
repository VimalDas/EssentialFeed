# Essential Feed

## Overview

- **Component and Module Relationships:** Represent component and module relationships in a diagram.
- **Modular Systems:** Accessing whether a system is more concrete or modular from its diagram representation.
- **Customized System Design:** Understanding that every system needs to be tailored, rather than fit a predefined template.

- **Team Processes:** 
- **Communication and Requirements:** 
- **Handling Lousy Requirements:**

- **Architecture Diagram:** Depict architecture diagrams that illustrate the implicit coupling between Networking and Caching modules.

### Testing Strategies
- **API Layer Testing:** 
- **Singleton Patterns:** When and why of singletons, as well as better alternatives.

- **Handling Network Errors:** 
- **Stubbing vs. Spying:** Differences between stubbing and spying when unit testing.
- **Code Coverage Strategies:** Extend code coverage by using samples of values to test specific test cases.
- **Enum-Based Design:** Design better code with enums to make invalid paths unrepresentable.
- **Mocking vs. Testing Collaborators:** Understanding the differences and trade-offs between mocking and testing collaborators in integration.
- **Architecture Protection:** Protect architecture abstractions by working with domain-specific models.
- **Simplifying Tests:** Simplify tests using factory methods and test helper functions.
- **Memory Leak Detection:** Automate memory leak detection with tests.
- **Async Error Prevention:** Preventing common async bugs and protecting the production code from test details.
- **Modularity Maintenance:** Maintain modularity by protecting high-level abstractions from low-level implementation details.
- **Asserting Asynchronous Behavior:** Assert asynchronous behavior with `XCTestCase` expectations.
- **Testing Network Requests:** 
- **Mocking Foundation Classes:** Techniques for subclass and protocol-based mocking of classes you don't own, such as the Foundation `URLSession` class.
- **URL Loading System:** 
- **Handling URL Requests:** Intercept and handle URL requests with `URLProtocol`.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** 
- **Test Feedback Economics:** 
- **Risk Minimization:** Minimize risk in the codebase and maximize learning by testing all scenarios, including error, invalid, and unhappy paths.
- **Refactoring Techniques:** Refactoring techniques for abstracting tests from implementation details.
- **Advanced Testing Configurations:** Running tests in random order, parallelizing test execution, and gathering code coverage.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Test client and server integration, even when the backend is still in development.
- **End-to-End Testing Economics:** Economics of end-to-end tests vs unit tests.
- **CI Pipeline Setup:** Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing.
- **Test Suite Integrity:** Improve test suite integrity by eliminating shared caching artifacts across test executions.
- **Iterative Requirements:** Minimize risk by reviewing, refining, and expanding requirements iteratively.
- **Iterative Design:** Advantages of iterative design over big upfront decision making.
- **Unit vs. Integration Tests:** Pros and cons of unit/isolated tests, including their performance, complexity, and making the most out of both.
- **Testing Pyramid:** Aiming for a healthy distribution of testing strategies, adhering to the ideal testing pyramid.
- **DSL for Tests:** Create a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) to decouple tests from implementation details.
- **Data Triangulation:** Increase test coverage and reduce the probability of errors by triangulating data points.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Test-drive cache invalidation to ensure robustness.

### Decoupling Business Logic
- **Use Case Design:** Decouple business logic encapsulated in use cases from framework details.

### Test-Driven Development
- **Collaborator Interfaces:** 
- **Test Coverage Enrichment:** 

### Codebase Health and Maintenance
- **Identifying Coupling:** Identifying highly coupled modules with visual representations of dependencies.
- **Dependency Bottlenecks:** Visualizing and solving dependency bottlenecks in codebase.
- **Modular Development:** Decentralize components to develop and deploy parts of the system in parallel.
- **Refactoring ROI:** Understanding the return on investment (ROI) of refactoring as a result of disciplined decoupling techniques.

### Requirements and Code Analysis
- **Requirements Evaluation:** Identifying bloated requirements and code with the Commandâ€“Query Separation principle.
- **Cross-Boundary Codable Requirements:** Prevent hidden-coupling implications of cross-boundary Codable requirements.

### Testing Best Practices
- **Documenting Infrastructure:** 
- **Real Framework Testing:** Test-drive infrastructure components in integration with real frameworks instead of mocks.
- **State Cleanup:** Prevent hard-to-debug test issues in stateful components by cleaning up the system state before and after test executions.
- **Test Time Measurement:** Use xcodebuild to measure test times and discover potential overheads.

### Codebase and Design
- **Codebase Health:** Analyze the health of codebase.
- **Async to Sync:** Turn asynchronous code into synchronous for expressiveness and readability in tests.
- **Code Structure Improvement:** Eliminate hard-to-read nested code (arrow-shaped code).

### Design Principles
- **Abstraction and Composition:** Monitor the impact of refactoring with quantitative analysis.
- **Dependency Control:** Improve test code by providing better names and making dependencies explicit.
- **Thread-Safe Components:** Design and test thread-safe components with DispatchQueue.
- **Queue Management:** Explore the differences between serial and concurrent dispatch queues.
- **Thread Safety:** Avoid threading race conditions that can lead to data corruption or crashes.
- **Value Types:** Design thread-safe(r) value types.

### Design Patterns
