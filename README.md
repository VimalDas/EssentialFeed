# Software Architecture, Design, and Testing in Swift

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to software architecture, design principles, and testing strategies in Swift.

## Key Topics
Explore the following key topics:

### Architecture and Design
- **Dependency Management:** Depict dependencies, abstractions, and concrete types in diagrams.
- **Diagram-to-Code Translation:** Translating diagrams into code and vice versa.
- **SOLID Principles:** Applying SOLID principles and composition through code.
- **Closures vs. Protocols:** Differences and similarities between closures and protocols as abstractions in Swift.
- **Component and Module Relationships:** Representing component and module relationships in diagrams.
- **Modular Systems:** Evaluating the modularity of a system based on its diagram representation.
- **Tailored Systems:** Recognizing the importance of tailoring systems to specific needs rather than fitting predefined templates.
- **Incremental Modularization:** Applying modularization incrementally.
- **Team Collaboration:** Understanding how good architecture is a byproduct of effective team processes.
- **Requirements Handling:** Discovering strategies for dealing with both well-defined and lousy requirements.
- **Requirement Representation:** Represent and communicate requirements in various formats.
- **Contract-Driven Development:** Contracts enable teams to develop independently, even when key system parts are not yet implemented.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Establishing processes that promote detailed documentation.
- **Project Starting Points:** Exploring the trade-offs of starting with abstractions or concrete components.
- **macOS Frameworks:** Speed up development using macOS frameworks.
- **Modular Design:** Embracing modular design principles for scalable and maintainable systems.
- **Singletons:** Understanding when and why to use singletons, better alternatives, and refactoring steps to reduce tight coupling.
- **Dependency Control:** Control dependencies through global instances or dependency injection.
- **Access Control:** Trade-offs of access control for testing purposes.
- **Testing Strategies:** Expand behavior checking and coverage using test spy objects.
- **Handling Network Errors:** Effective techniques for handling network errors.
- **Stubbing and Spying:** Differences between stubbing and spying in unit testing.
- **Code Coverage:** Extend code coverage with sample values for specific test cases.
- **Design with Enums:** Utilize enums to make invalid paths unrepresentable.
- **Mocking vs. Testing Collaborators:** Explore the trade-offs between mocking and testing collaborators in integration.
- **Decodable Protocol:** Map JSON data to native models using the Decodable protocol.
- **Architecture Abstractions:** Protect your architecture abstractions with domain-specific models.
- **Simplified Tests:** Simplify tests using factory methods and test helper functions.
- **Memory Leak Detection:** Automate memory leak detection with tests.
- **Async Bugs Prevention:** Prevent common async bugs in your code.
- **Production Code Protection:** Protect production code from test details.
- **Modularity Maintenance:** Maintain modularity by shielding high-level abstractions from low-level implementation details.
- **Swift Error Protocol:** Deal with potential issues when using the Swift Error protocol.
- **Pattern Matching:** Utilize pattern matching with Swift enums.
- **Async Behavior Assertion:** Assert asynchronous behavior with XCTest expectations.
- **Testing Network Requests:** Learn various testing strategies for network requests.
- **Mocking with Protocols:** Subclass and protocol-based mocking for classes you don't own.
- **URL Loading System:** Explore the little-known URL Loading System.
- **URL Request Handling:** Intercept and handle URL requests with URLProtocol.
- **Test Feedback Economics:** Understand the economics of test feedback.
- **Minimizing Risk:** Minimize risk and maximize learning by testing all scenarios.
- **Test Refactoring:** Refactor tests to abstract implementation details.
- **Testing Configurations:** Configure tests to run in random order, parallelize execution, and gather code coverage.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Test client and server integration even when the backend is in development.
- **End-to-End vs. Unit Tests:** Explore the economics of end-to-end tests vs. unit tests.
- **CI Pipeline Setup:** Learn to set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

## Conclusion
This repository offers a wealth of knowledge and practical guidance for Swift developers looking to excel in software architecture, design, and testing. Explore the topics and resources provided to enhance your skills and build robust, maintainable Swift applications.
